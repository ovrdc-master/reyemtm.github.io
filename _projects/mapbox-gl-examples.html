about: >-
  As part of my GIS work funded by the Appalachian Regional Commission I have researched the effectiveness of a clien-side parcel viewer. [This post](https://getbounds.com/blog/leaflet-and-geojson-tiles/) outlines the progress of that work, however client-side scripting has its drawbacks. The main issue when dealing with client-side rendering for GIS is the number of vertices and overall size of the vector layers. This led to experimenting with vector tiles and Mapbox GL JS. OVRDC currently has a vector tiles server in testing (see [mbtiles-server](https://github.com/ratrun/mbtiles-server)). This server powers several Mapbox GL based maps, as well as some of the basemaps for all of OVRDC's maps using Leaflet 1.0+. Since the Mapbox GL maps use a new web map API, I thought it would be cool to test out a new framework for the maps as well. I landed on Google's [Material Design Light](https://getmdl.io/started/), inspired by the work of Tobin Bradley.
